# jsonista

This project is to explore some ideas I have for processing json.

I'm starting out with a JavaScript page generator that accepts markdown and HTML templates, but uses JSON for intermediate steps. I've created [issues](https://github.com/jsonista/jsonista/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open) and a [milestone](https://github.com/jsonista/jsonista/issues?milestone=2) for this first step.
