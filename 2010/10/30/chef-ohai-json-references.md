# Chef, Ohai, and JSON References

[Interesting article](http://blog.b3k.us/the_80_percent.html) by 
[Benjamin Black](http://twitter.com/b6n) on the evolution of Chef 
and how extra code must be written to extract info because of 
the lack of a good JSON reference format for the Ohai developers 
to use. When I met [John Williams](http://twitter.com/j_m_williams)
about a month ago, he spoke of the same problem, namely getting
objects by their IP addresses. Certainly a problem I'm interested
in writing code and/or docs to help solve.
