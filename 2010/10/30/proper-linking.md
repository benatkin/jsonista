# Proper Linking

I'm answering the call to action in Kyle Cordes' post,
[If you like it, make a link to it – a plea for real links](http://kylecordes.com/2010/like-it-link-it).
Not telling the search engines that content is worthwhile 
is one problem with using Facebook and bit.ly to share links.
Another is that I don't have an easy-to-use copy of my own 
links that I can revisit later.

If I blog links, I can download my blog posts, parse the 
links, connect the tags, and examine them later. I want 
to go farther than this, which is why I'm storing links, 
and a lot of other things, in CouchDB databases.

Having easy access to information sources from which I've 
partially acquired knowledge is important.
